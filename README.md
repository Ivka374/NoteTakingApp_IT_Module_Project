## About
### Structure
The project uses the Windows Presentation Foundation(WPF). Its structure is based off of the MVVM model.
### Uses
The project serves as a simple application, that allows the user to store and edit notes as they desire. 
Those notes can be styled accordingly with the modern design of the app. 
The app has some groundwork for also allowing the user to add musical scores to their notes. 
This feature, though, still remains in development.

### Difficulty level
The libraryies enabling the storing and display of mmusical scores and symbols have little to no documentation online and practically no useful information readily available on them. That has lead to postponng said functionality until later versions despite the time and effort already spent on it.  
Another issue that arose was the availability of the database during testing on different machines. This has lead to many hiccups in the production of this app and has been a priorty due to the vital role it plays.  
Last, but not least comes the challenge of using WPF itself. As somebody with a slight amount of experience using JavaFX, which would translate nto .xml files, the front-end developer decided to explore this form of solution. That proved to be far more challenging than expected, however, the realization had been reach far too late into development and has certainly been a burden throughout the process.  
Regardless, through the joint effort and collaboration of the team, a working and cohesive version of the application has been completed.
